Transitioning from a dynamic career in commerce to the world of coding, my journey has been shaped by diverse experiences. As a former Senior Cloud Engineer at AHEAD and TEKsystems, I've managed updates, delved into Cloud-Native Architecture, and navigated IT service management. Now, as a Junior Full Stack Engineer, I bring this unique blend of skills to the coding realm. Trained at The App Brewery's web development bootcamp in London, I specialize in .NET, C#, React, and Bootstrap.
